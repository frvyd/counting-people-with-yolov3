# counting-people-with-yolov3

This Python code performs object recognition with YOLOv3 on a video stream and counts only objects belonging to the "person" class. Also, when it detects people, it draws boxes surrounding these people and shows the numbers on the screen. 

## How to use
1. Save the Code:
   Save the code with a .py extension; for example, arge_opencv.py

2. Load the YOLO network:
   https://opencv-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yolo/yolo.html

3. Create File:
   Save "coco.names", "yolov3.cfg", "yolov3.weights" files in the same folder as the .py extension code file.
   
4. Run the Code :)
   
5. View Counting People on Camera
   After running the script, you will see people being framed and counted in the live video from your camera.

6. Exit the Program:
   To exit the program, press the 'q' key in the command prompt window.
